# docs-data
exist-db documentation data

This is for help with developing the next version of the documentation. 
This repo will automatically stay in sync with content changes in the main documentation repo. 
It is easiest to include as a submodule, remember to clone recursively.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eXist-db/docs-data.git
```

Please use as *READ_ONLY* changes to currently released version of the docs should still go to the [documentation repo](https://github.com/exist-db/documentation)
